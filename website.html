<h3>
  Early life and College
  </h3>
    
<p>
   Rosalind Franklin was a chemist and and X-ray crystallographer. She was born on July 25, 1920. She attended Newnham College, Cambridge in 1938 where she studied chemistry. In 1941, she was awarded second-class honours from her final exams. At college, she was awarded a research fellowship and she joined the physical chemistry labritory of the University of Cambridge. She studied the porosity of coal using helium to determine its density. Through this, she discovered the relationship between the fine constrictions in the pores of coals and the permeability of the porous space. By concluding that substances were expelled in order of molecular size as temperature increased, she helped classify coals and accurately predict their performance for fuel purposes and for production of wartime devices such as gas masks. This work was the basis of her Ph.D. thesis The physical chemistry of solid organic colloids with special reference to coal for which the University of Cambridge University awarded her a Ph.D. in 1945. It was also the basis of several papers.

<h3>
  DNA
</h3>

<p>
  Franklin was well known for her X-ray photo of DNA. This photo was called "Photo 51". This picture was called by John Desmond Bernal  "amongst the most beautiful X-ray photographs of any substance ever taken". This picture along with lots of research led to the discovery of the double helix structure. Franklin was never nominated for a Nobel Prize. Her work was a crucial part in the discovery of DNA's structure, which along with subsequent related work led to Francis Crick, James Watson, and Maurice Wilkins being awarded a Nobel Prize in 1962. She had died in 1958, and during her lifetime the DNA structure was not considered as fully proven. It took Wilkins and his colleagues about seven years to collect enough data to prove and refine the proposed DNA structure, but they couldn't have done this if Franklin hadn't done the amazing things she did.
